    "In a \"real\" case, there are at least three more things to do:\n",

    "1. Increase the number of walkers. More is better! But, too many walkers will slow down the run. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Let the run continue until the chain reaches the \"convergence\". The adopted non-convergence statistical test is the Gelman-Rubin $\\hat{R}$ statistic (see Gelman et al. 2003). This test compares the variance of any quantity $x$ estimated from each of the individual chains (resp. chain) to the variance of the estimates of the mean $x$ from the different chains (resp. part of the chain)(Ford 2006). We have adopted the second solution, that is to say the $\\hat{R}$ is calculated between two sub-chains, respectively $[\\text{burnin},\\text{burnin}+(1-\\text{burnin})/4]$ and $[1-(1-\\text{burnin})/4,1]$ parts of the main flattened chain. For example, if *burnin* is set to $0.5$, the sub-chains will be $[0.5, 0.625]$ and $[0.875, 1]$. As the Markov chain approaches convergence, $\\hat{R}(p_i)$ approaches 1 from above. We can define two more parameters related to this statistical test:\n",
